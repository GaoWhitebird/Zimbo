For each eligible item, the member will receive a unique bar code sticker in the mail to be affixed to the reusable cup.\nEach time a member shops and uses their cup, they simply open the zimbo app and scan the barcode, contributing to their green score. The same applies to a vast library of environmentally friendly products, such as reusable shopping bags, reusable water bottles and many others.';
